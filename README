This is a simple ssh obfuscating proxy -- it xors every byte of SSH traffic 
with 0x19. This is enough to defeat DPI systems that try to look at the SSH
handshake / version string to identify SSH traffic. Unlike all the other code 
i've seen that obfuscates SSH traffic, sshxor doesn't require root access or 
patching the SSH codebase.

The code in chunkssh.pl is not mine -- it's Brian Hatch's, and I used some of 
their code to avoid reimplementing the annoying bits like forking and opening
sockets. See http://insecure.org/stc/sti.html for the original copy of 
chunkssh.pl (you need to search for "chunkssh.pl", it's about halfway through 
the page).

It's possible to use other DPI methods to block SSH traffic xored with 0x19.
An easy way to do so is to look at packet sizes/timing or just to XOR some 
bytes of traffic with each other (A xor B = (A xor key) xor (B xor key), so 
the result of this calculation is not changed xoring each byte of traffic with
a constant), and see if they match the xor'd together values of what the DPI 
system is looking for.
