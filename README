This is a simple ssh obfuscating proxy -- it xors every byte of SSH traffic 
with 0x19. This is enough to defeat DPI systems that try to look at the SSH
handshake / version string to identify SSH traffic. Unlike existing code that
obfuscates SSH traffic, this doesn't require root access or patching the SSH 
codebase.

The code in chunkssh.pl is not mine -- it's Brian Hatch's, and I used some of 
their code to avoid reimplementing the annoying bits like forking and opening
sockets. See http://insecure.org/stc/sti.html for the original copy of 
chunkssh.pl (you need to search for "chunkssh.pl", it's about halfway through 
the page).
